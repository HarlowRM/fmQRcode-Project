## Introduction

I recently learned about HTML and CSS with freeCodeCamp, I wanted to start growing my skills by building some projects outside of a guided course. 
 
I chose this QR code component because I wanted to start with something very simple, as I didn't want to overwhelm myself for my first project.

## My process

I started by reviewing the design samples and breaking down the design into individual components. Once I had a bit of a plan, I stared laying out all the key components in HTML, (the container, img, text, etc.) I then created and linked my CSS style sheet and got to work on the styling to get it as close to the design samples as possible.

### Built with

- Non-Semantic HTML5
